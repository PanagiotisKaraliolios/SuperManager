# SuperManager
Super Market Manager

This project was being developed during the course of software engineering
in the 4th semester at the University of Macedonia which is based in Thessaloniki, Greece. 

This project is about a super market managing system that can provide every functionality
that a modern super market needs.

In order to operate this program, you need to download xampp and create a database named "sm".
Then you need to import the SQL file provided in the release section. Feel free to change the database as you wish.
The provided one has already some registrations for you to understand how it works.

Default manager credentials in the database are username:admin, password:admin

In the release section you can also find a compiled jar file. First, you should make sure that you have properly installed 
java(JDK or JRE) on your machine.
