Super Market Manager

This project was being developed during the course of software engineering
in the 4th semester at the University of Macedonia which is based in Thessaloniki. 

This project is about a super market manager system that can provide every functionality
that a modern super market needs.

In order to operate this program, you need to download xampp and create a database named "sm".
Then you need to import the SQL file provided in the release section. Feel free to change the database as you wish.

Default manager credentials in the database are username:admin, password:admin
